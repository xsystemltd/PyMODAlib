    Group wavelet phase coherence algorithm. Calculates coherence for a single group, whose members each
    have a signal A and a signal B.

        You can also pass *args and **kwargs to this function, which will be used when
        performing the wavelet transform. For example, `wavelet=”Morlet”`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals_a : ndarray
        [2D array] The set of signals A for each member of the group.
    signals_b : ndarray
        [2D array] The set of signals B for each member of the group.
    fs : float
        The sampling frequency of the signals.
    percentile : float, optional
        (Default value = 95) The percentile of the surrogates which will be subtracted from the coherence.
    cleanup : bool, optional
        (Default value = True) Whether to clean up the cache folder after completion.
    wavelet_args : Any, optional
        Arguments to pass to the wavelet transform function.
    wavelet_kwargs : Any, optional
        Keyword arguments to pass to the wavelet transform function.

    Returns

    freq : ndarray
        [1D array] The frequencies.
    coh : ndarray
        [2D array] The residual coherence.
